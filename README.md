# NOAA-SCAT-Standard

(https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6370202/7496276/df14f7ca-f3d8-11e4-8086-d51a3754dff4.jpg) This repository contains a proposed data standard for observational Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Technique (SCAT) data collected by field survey teams during oil spills and similar incidents to evaluate shoreline oiling, recommend and guide treatment, and document compliance with cleanup endpoints. This draft standard was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R), Emergency Response Division (ERD). This standard is provided to the response community as a common point of reference in the development of electronic field data collection tools, databases and information products for SCAT activities. This is a voluntary standard that will be maintained and updated by NOAA based on input from the response community and the evolution of new technologies.

The draft data standard proposed here includes:

- A conceptual data model, consisting of a set of proposed entities and relationships,
- Rules for spatial representation of these entities,
- Required core tabular attributes describing these entities,
- Required spatial relationships and logical relationships between entities, and
- Minimum documentation requirements.

Currently, this repository contains only a draft document describing the proposed standard.  In the future, template spatial and tabular data structures will be deposited here.
